# The Soft-DNS server
## Objective
Your assignment is to implement domain URL to IP resolver service (DNS Server) using Python and no framework.
## Brief
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4)

## Tasks
Implement assignment using:  
- Language: Python  
- Framework: no framework  

Two features are required:  
- **register** – register domain with IPv4  
- **resolve** – resolve domain-based URL to IPv4 and vice versa  

Provide a markdown file with the following:  
- Detailed instructions on how to run your assignment
- Justification of selected approach
- Solution limitations 
- Possible improvements  

Provide tests for both solutions and their use cases using Python Unit Testing framework (or similar).
## Evaluation Criteria
**Completeness:** Did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?  
**Correctness:** Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?  
**Maintainability:** Is it written in a clean, maintainable way?  

## Sample domains
| Domain      | URL         | IPv4 | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| google.com      | https://www.google.com      |  172.217.1.110    |
| Yahoo.com   | https://www.yahoo.com       |   74.6.231.21  |
| NHL.com   | https://www.nhl.com       |   104.18.17.236   |
| Python.org   | https://www.python.org       |  151.101.193.168   |
